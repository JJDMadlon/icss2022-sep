# Readme for B_Compiler assignment

This repository is a fork of a template project that was made for me by my university (HAN University of applied sciences).
The assignment is to make a compiler with help of ANTLR4. For the assignment I have to implement the grammar for ICSS.
This is the direct translation of the assignment description:
"In this assignment you will create your own CSS dialect: ICSS-20-SEP. An informal description of this language can be found in Appendix A. Read this description carefully! In this assignment you will continue to build an interactive Java application: the ICSSTool. This tool is an interactive compiler. You can interactively edit ICSS in it and compile it step by step to CSS. You can then export this CSS. You will receive the framework for the ICSS tool as starting code. The GUI has already been created and all components are present in minimal form. The assignment consists of completing the tool through a series of partial assignments."
